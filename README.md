# Hi there 👋

I am a PhD researcher in Mathematical Biology specializing in climate-driven vector population modeling, ecological simulation, and data analysis.  
I build deterministic and stochastic models, analyze large climate datasets, and evaluate model sensitivity to support public health and ecological decision-making.

## Core Skills
- **Modeling**: ODE-based, stochastic  
- **Climate Data**: Temperature, rainfall, photoperiod  
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: LHS, PRCC  
- **Visualization**: ggplot2, patchwork  
- **Communication**: Publications, conferences

## 📌 Featured Projects
- [**Mosquito Dynamics Model**] – Simulates stage-structured mosquito populations using climate inputs.  
- [**Climate Data Analysis**] – Processes and visualizes historical climate data (2008–2023).  
- [**Sensitivity Analysis**] – Quantifies parameter influence on model outputs with LHS & PRCC.
